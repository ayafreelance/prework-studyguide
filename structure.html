          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> "<!Doctyp html>" and other declarations are not case-sensitive but html elements etc. are </li>
            <li> Webpages need to know the website is using html language which is what the declaration does. </li>
            <li> Changes can be made to html documents, and updated through the creation of a new branch on your repository using terminal (mac) </li>
            <li> It typically consists of three sections: a head, body and footer</li>
            <li> Some are sematic html elements i.e. they function and hold content according to their name e.g. body holds the body of the webpage content. Section is another element </li>
            <li> Head holds metadata and meta tags that allow retrieval of information from external sources that allows for better performance, search engine optimisation (i.e. better ranking in google search/bing/safari</li>

        <h2> CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Style your website using inline, internal and external CSS stylesheets</li>
            <ol>
              <li> Inline: direct changes to elements using the style attribute 
                Pros; quick, permanent changes
                Cons; less flexible than external and internal style sheets

                Implementation: 
                "header-1  "style=color:d";> header_title end header-1>"
              </li>
              <li> Internal stylesheet: embedded within head and applies to entire website 

                Implementation: 
                " <head> 
                  <style>
                    h1
                  {
                    "color:red;"
                  } 
                  </style>"
                  </li>
                
                  <li> External style sheet: Involves attaching link to external file within a link tag in the head of html doc </li>
                    Pros: Better for organisation 
              
                      Implementation:

          <li> Git is the version control system that we use to connect local work to the online cloud-system Github. </li>
          <li>You can navigate between branches using commands such as git checkout main and git checkout -b feature/_____ . The latter creates a new branch. </li>
          <li> Always check which branch you are in prior to and after using commands to make sure further alterations and additions are made to the correct working branch!</li>
          <li> To do this, use command - git status </li>
