# Prework Study Guide 

## Description

Project Description
I was motivated to create this website because I needed an organised place to keep all my notes. The result was a combination of html, css and javascript to produce an appealing looking website with boxes to denominate the topics I have notes on. It also allows you to get a direct referall of what to study rather than pondering. I learn a about how the three files interact, and how to complete the git flow. I did it by using terminal and VS code to power the git local work and merging this with the online folder. 


## Installation

## Usage

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
